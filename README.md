# RFramework
RFramework

This is a framework for 2D platform games, this framework includes some systems, such as EventSystem, SaveSystem, and SceneTeleportSystem etc. This framework is based on the MVC architectureï¼Œ and I hope this Framework can help beginners who want to make games.

# What is currently in this framework
1. EventSystem
2. SceneTeleportSystem
3. HitSystem
4. ObjectPool
5. Factory Pattern
6. SaveSystem

I will continue to update this Framework until it is finished, and I will put other systems into it, for example, a Framework for UI and a Framework for ILRuntime.

Of course, if you have advice, you also can email me, and we can make this Framework better. My email address is: 18367398532xjl@gmail.com
